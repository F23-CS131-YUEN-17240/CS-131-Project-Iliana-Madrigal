# CS-131-Project-Iliana-Madrigal

Hello everyone, my name is Iliana Madrigal and the topic that I chose is Check Digits. Check Digits are digits that are calculated using a particular formula and using congruence a ≡ b (mod m). Check Digits are used to be able to find errors in data, to check if the given data is valid, identify products, and many other uses. For every use there is a particular algorithm that needs to be used but these all end up using congruences. These check digits are usually at the end of the data, and they are used to confirm if it is valid or to be identified. They are used in many things that are around us such as the ISBN numbers in books, USPS money orders, Drivers License number, and many more. In the presentation I give more explanation on what check digits are and show some of the algorithms and how they are used through different examples.
